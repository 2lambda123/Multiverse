<h2>Building the project</h2>
You need to install <a href="http://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a> 1.0 Milestone 9
(<a href="http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.0-milestone-9-bin.zip">download</a>). If you go to the root directory
and type 'gradle -i' (the -i adds progress information) the project will automatically be compiled and the
artifacts will also be stored in your local maven repository. Other important commands:
<pre>
    //builds the jar from scratch (unit tests are not executed)
    gradle -i clean install

    //runs the tests
    gradle -i test

    //runs the integration tests (this can some time).
    gradle -i integrationtest
</pre>
